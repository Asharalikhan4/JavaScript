/*

Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
Your tasks:
1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their fullname, mass,and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI(the same method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI,together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"
Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
GOOD LUCKðŸ˜€
