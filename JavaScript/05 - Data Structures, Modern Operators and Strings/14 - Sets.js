/*

Set objects are collections of values. A value in the set may only occur once; it is unique in the set's collection. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. The insertion order corresponds to the order in which each element was inserted into the set by the add() method successfully (that is, there wasn't an identical element already in the set when add() was called).

The specification requires sets to be implemented "that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection". Therefore, it could be represented internally as a hash table (with O(1) lookup), a search tree (with O(log(N)) lookup), or any other data structure, as long as the complexity is better than O(N).

Just like other's set also has some methods that we can use to make our work easy.

// Implementation

const mySet1 = new Set();

mySet1.add(1); // Set(1) { 1 }
mySet1.add(5); // Set(2) { 1, 5 }
mySet1.add(5); // Set(2) { 1, 5 }
mySet1.add("some text"); // Set(3) { 1, 5, 'some text' }
const o = { a: 1, b: 2 };
mySet1.add(o);

mySet1.add({ a: 1, b: 2 }); // o is referencing a different object, so this is okay

mySet1.has(1); // true
mySet1.has(3); // false, since 3 has not been added to the set
mySet1.has(5); // true
mySet1.has(Math.sqrt(25)); // true
mySet1.has("Some Text".toLowerCase()); // true
mySet1.has(o); // true

mySet1.size; // 5

mySet1.delete(5); // removes 5 from the set
mySet1.has(5); // false, 5 has been removed

mySet1.size; // 4, since we just removed one value

mySet1.add(5); // Set(5) { 1, 'some text', {...}, {...}, 5 } - a previously deleted item will be added as a new item, it will not retain its original position before deletion

console.log(mySet1); // Set(5) { 1, "some text", {…}, {…}, 5 }


// Looping over sets

for (const item of mySet1) {
    console.log(item);
}
// 1, "some text", { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, 5

for (const item of mySet1.keys()) {
    console.log(item);
}
// 1, "some text", { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, 5

for (const item of mySet1.values()) {
    console.log(item);
}
// 1, "some text", { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, 5

// key and value are the same here
for (const [key, value] of mySet1.entries()) {
    console.log(key);
}
// 1, "some text", { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, 5

// Convert Set object to an Array object, with Array.from
const myArr = Array.from(mySet1); // [1, "some text", {"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": 1, "b": 2}, 5]
