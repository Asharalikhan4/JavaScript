In JavaScript, expressions and statements are fundamental components of the language, each serving a distinct purpose:

Expression:

An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be a single value, a combination of values, or a function call.
Expressions are typically used within statements. They can be as simple as a single variable or literal value, or they can be more complex, involving operators and function calls.
Examples of expressions:
5 (a literal number)
x + y (the result of an addition operation)
functionCall() (the result of calling a function)


Statement:

A statement is a line of code that performs an action. Statements are used to control the flow and behavior of a program. They don't produce a value in the same way that expressions do.
Statements can include variable declarations, loops, conditionals, function declarations, and more.
Examples of statements:
Variable declaration: var x = 5;
Conditional statement: if (condition) 
Loop statement: for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
Function declaration: function myFunction() 
In summary, expressions are used to produce values, while statements are used to perform actions or control the flow of a program. In JavaScript, you often use expressions within statements to compute values and make decisions based on those values. Understanding the distinction between expressions and statements is crucial for writing effective and readable JavaScript code.
